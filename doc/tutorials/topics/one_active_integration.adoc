{prodname} displays the integration summary page with a *Publishing* spinning
circle. {prodname} is generating the runtime for the integration and
will start it when the runtime is ready. This takes a few minutes.

[NOTE]
====
A Fuse Online account is limited to a specific number of 
integrations that can be running at one time. For details, 
see the pricing plan. If you are already running the maximum
number of integrations, then you must unpublish an integration
before you can publish (start running) another one. 

If you are using a Fuse Online evaluation 
account, then only one integration at a time can be running (published). 
If you already created one of the other sample integrations and that
integration is running then this integration is automatically in the
*Unpublished* state. You must stop the running integration by 
unpublishing it. You can then publish this integration.  
====

If you are already running the maximum number of integrations, follow
these steps to unpublish (stop) an integration:

. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
. In the entry for the integration that you want to stop, click
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[title="the three vertical dots"]
on the far right. 
. In the popup, click *Unpublish*. 

After unpublishing an integration, start another integration as follows:

. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
. In the entry for the integration that you want to start, click
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[title="the three vertical dots"]
on the far right.
