= Register {prodname} as a Salesforce client

You must register your installation of {prodname} as an application
that can access Salesforce.
This lets you create any number of integrations that connect
to Salesforce. In other words, you need to register a particular 
installation of {prodname} with Salesforce only once.

ifeval::["{context}" == "t2sf"]
If you already registered {prodname} as a Salesforce
client and created a Salesforce connection, skip to <<create-twitter-sf-integration>>.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{context}" == "sf2db"]
If you already registered {prodname} as a Salesforce
client and created a Salesforce connection, skip to  <<create-sf-db-integration>>.
endif::[]


Perform these steps to register {prodname} as a Salesforce client:

. In {prodname}:
.. In the left panel, click *Home*.
.. Copy the {prodname} URL from the browser address bar so it is in the
clipboard.
.. In the left panel, click *Settings*.
.. In the *OAuth Application Management* page, to the right of *Salesforce*,
click *Register* to display the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* fields.
. In another browser tab, log in to your Salesforce account and
follow the steps below to create a connected app.
These instructions assume that you are
using the Salesforce Classic user interface. To switch from the
Salesforce Lightning Experience interface, click your profile icon and select
*Switch to Salesforce Classic*.
For additional information, see the Salesforce documentation for
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=connected_app_create.htm[Create a Connected App].
.. In Salesforce, in the upper right, click *Setup*.
.. In the left panel, select *Build* > *Create* > *Apps*.
.. Scroll down to *Connected Apps* and click *New*.
.. Enter the required information and then select *Enable OAuth Settings*.
.. In the *Callback URL* field, paste your
{prodname} URL, which you copied in step 2.
Remove `dashboard` from the end of the URL
and append `api/v1/credentials/callback`. For example:
`\https://app-proj9128.7b63.{prodnameinurl}.openshiftapps.com/api/v1/credentials/callback`.
.. For *OAuth Scopes*, add:
** *Access and manage your data*
** *Allow access to your unique identifier*
** *Perform requests on your behalf at any time*
.. Select *Include ID token* and then *Include Standard Claims*.
.. Scroll down and click *Save*.
.. Scroll up to see that Salesforce indicates a short wait:

.. Click *Continue*.
.. Copy the consumer key that Salesforce provides.
. Return to your {prodname} installation *Settings* page and paste the
Salesforce-provided
consumer key into the Salesforce *Client ID* field.
. Back in Salesforce, copy the consumer secret that Salesforce provides.
. Return to your {prodname} installation *Settings* page and paste the
Salesforce-provided consumer secret into the Salesforce
*Client Secret* field.
. Click *Save* and then click *Ok*.
