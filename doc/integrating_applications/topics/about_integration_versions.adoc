= About integration lifecycle handling

After you create and publish an integration, you  might want to update
what the integration does. You can edit a draft of the published integration
and then replace the initial running version with the updated version.
To facilitate this, for each integration, {prodname} maintains multiple
versions as well as each version's state. The following topics provide
an understanding of the behavior to help you manage your integrations.
