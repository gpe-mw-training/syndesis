= Unpublishing integrations

Each integration can have exactly one version that is running. A running
version is in the *Published* state. To stop
running an integration, you unpublish it.

To unpublish an integration:

. In the left {prodname} panel, click *Integrations*.
. In the list of integrations, identify the entry for the integration that you
want to stop running. The entry shows that this integration *Published*.
. At the far right of this integration's entry, click

and select *Unpublish*.

{prodname} stops running the integration. *Unpublished* appears in the
integration's entry in the list of integrations.
