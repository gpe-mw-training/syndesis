= Register {prodname} as a Dropbox client

You must register your installation of {prodname} as an application
that can access Dropbox.
This lets you create any number of integrations that connect
to Dropbox. In other words, you need to register a particular
installation of {prodname} with Dropbox only once.

In each {prodname} environment, there can be only one registration
of {prodname} as a Dropbox client. However, while each Dropbox 
connection uses the same registration, it can use different user
credentials. 

Perform these steps:

. In {prodname}:
.. In the left panel, click *Settings*.
.. Near the top of the page, in the sentence that starts with
`*During registration, enter this callback URL:*`,
copy the URL at the end of that sentence to the clipboard. 
For example, the URL is something like this:
`\https://app-proj9128.7b63.{prodnameinurl}.openshiftapps.com/api/v1/credentials/callback`.

. In another browser tab, go  to `https://www.dropbox.com` 
and do the following:
.. Sign in to the Dropbox account that has the data that you want to
access in an integration. 
.. After signing in, go to https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps.
.. Click *Create App*.
.. Select *Dropbox API*. 
.. Choose whether {prodname} can access a single folder or all of the 
folders and files. 
.. Specify a name for your Dropbox app. For example, you might
specify `*Ignite Access From Aslan LLC*`. The name you specify must be
unique in the set of Dropbox app names. 
.. Check the box to indicate that you agree to Dropbox API terms and 
conditions. 
.. Click *Create App*. 

.. In the Dropbox *Settings* page for your new app, in
the input field for *OAuth2 Redirect URIs*, paste your {prodname} URL,
which you copied to the clipboard at the beginning of this procedure. 
.. Click *Add*. 

Your installation of {prodname} is now registered as a Dropbox client, which 
means that {prodname} can access content in the Dropbox account that
you signed into.
