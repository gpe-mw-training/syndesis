= Connecting to proprietary databases


To connect to a proprietary SQL database, the main tasks that must be
accomplished are as follows:

. A developer creates a library extension that contains the JDBC driver 
for the database that you want to access in an integration. 
See <<creating-jdbc-driver-library-extensions>>. 

. The developer provides a `.jar` file that contains the library extension.

. You upload that `.jar` file to {prodname}. See 
<<making-extensions-available>>.

. You create a connection to your database by selecting the 
{prodname} *Database* connector and specifying the connection URL
for your database. See <<create-database-connection>>. 

. In an integration, you add the connection to your database. 
See <<add-database-connection>>.
