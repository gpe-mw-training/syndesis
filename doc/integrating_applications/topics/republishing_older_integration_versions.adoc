= Republishing older integration versions

You might publish an integration that does not work the way you want it to.
In this situation, you can stop the incorrect version
and replace it with a version that you published previously and that
runs correctly.

To republish an older integration version:

. In the left panel, click *Integrations* to display a list of the
the integrations in this environment.
. Click the entry for the integration for which you want to publish
an older version. {prodname} displays a list of the versions of the
integration. 
. In the entry for the version that is running, at the far right, click
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Kebab] and select
*Unpublish*.
. Click *OK* to confirm that you want to stop running this version.
. Wait for *Unpublished* to appear to the right of the integration name near
the top of the page.
. Optionally, before you publish the older version, you can update it: 
.. In the entry for the integration version that you want to update, 
at the far right, click  
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Kebab] and select *Replace Draft*.
.. Update the integration as needed. For details, see <<updating-integrations>>.
.. When updates are complete, in the upper right, click *Publish*, 
and then click *OK* to confirm. This takes the place of the next two steps. 
. To publish the older version as is, in the entry for the integration 
version that you want to start
running again, at the far right, click
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Kebab]
and select *Publish*.
. Click *OK* to confirm that you want to publish this version of the
integration.

{prodname} publishes
the integration, which takes a few minutes. When the integration 
is running, then *Published version _n_* appears to the right
of the integration's name.
