= Obtaining authorization to access applications

:context: ug
In an integration, you might want to connect to an application that uses
the OAuth protocol to authenticate access requests. To do this,
you must register your installation of {prodname} for access to that application.
Registration authorizes all connections from your {prodname} installation
to a given application. For example, if you register your {prodname}
installation with Salesforce, all connections from your {prodname}
installation to Salesforce use the same client ID and the same client secret.

[NOTE]
====
For information about using custom connectors that let 
you access applications that use the
OAuth protocol, see <<creating-connections-from-custom-connectors>>.

Registration needs to happen before
you can create a connection to the application. For example, after you register
your installation of
{prodname} as an application that can access Salesforce, then you can
create a Salesforce connection.

While the specific steps vary for each application you want to connect to,
registration always provides your installation of {prodname} with a client ID and
a client secret that you copy into your {prodname} *OAuth Application
Management* page. Some applications use other labels for the client ID
and client secret. For example, Salesforce generates a consumer key and
a consumer secret.

To register {prodname} with an application, the main steps are:

. In {prodname}, in the left panel, click *Settings*.
. In the *OAuth Application Management* page, in the entry for the
application with which you want to register {prodname},
click *Register* to display the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* fields.
. In another browser tab, go to the web site for the application you
want to register with and perform the steps required to obtain
a client ID and secret. One of these steps requires you to enter
the URL for your installation of {prodname}.
. On your {prodname} installation *Settings* page, paste the
client ID and client secret and save the settings.
