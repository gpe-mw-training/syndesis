= Publishing a message to an MQTT broker

In an integration, you can publish a message to an MQTT broker to finish
an integration. To do this, add an MQTT connection as the integration's 
finish connection. To publish a message to an MQTT broker in the
middle of integration, add an MQTT connection to an integration after
the start connection and before the finish connection. 

To add an MQTT connection that publishes a message:

. Start creating the integration.
. Add and configure the start connection.
. On the *Choose a Finish Connection* page, do one of the following:
+
* To finish an integration by publishing a message, click the MQTT connection 
that you want to use. 
* To publish a message in the middle of an integration, click the connection you
want to use to finish the integration. Configure that connection. When the
finish connection is part of the integration, in the left panel, hover over
the plus sign where you want to add an MQTT connection and click
*Add a connection*. Click the MQTT connection that you want to use
to publish a message in the middle of an integration. 

. On the *Choose an Action* page, click *Publish*. 
. In the *MQTT queue/topic name* field, specify the name of he queue or
topic to publish the message to. 
. Click *Done* to add the connection to the integration.
