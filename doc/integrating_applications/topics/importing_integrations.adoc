= Importing integrations

To import an integration:

:context: ug
. Open the {prodname} environment that you want to import the integration into.
. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
. In the upper right, click *Import*.
. Drag and drop one or more exported integration zip files,
or navigate to a zip file that contains an exported integration and select it.
. After {prodname} imports the file(s), click *Done*. {prodname} displays
information about imported integrations.
. In the left panel, click *Connections*.
+
If an imported integration uses a connection that requires configuration,
then there is a *Configuration Required* message at the bottom of the
connection's card.

. For each connection that requires configuration:

.. Click it to display its details.
.. Enter or change connection details as needed. It is possible that every
field on this page is correct and that only security configuration is required.
.. If you updated any fields, click *Save*.
.. In the left panel, click *Settings*.
+
The *Settings* page displays entries for applications that use the OAuth
protocol. 

. For each connection that requires configuration and that accesses an
application that uses the OAuth protocol, register this installation of
{prodname} with the application. The steps vary for each application.
See the appropriate topic:

* <<register-with-dropbox>>
* <<register-with-rest-api>>
* <<register-with-salesforce_{context}>>
* <<register-with-twitter>>

. In the left panel, click *Connections* and confirm that there are no
longer any connections that require configuration.
. In the left panel, click *Integrations*. 
. In the list of integrations, at the right of the entry for the
integration that you imported, click 
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Three Vertical Dots] and
select *Edit*. 
. In the upper right, click *Save as Draft* or, if you want to start
running the imported integration, click *Publish*. Regardless of whether
you save the integration as a draft or you publish the integration, 
{prodname} updates the integration to use the updated connections.
