= Adding a Dropbox connection to an integration

You must create a Dropbox connection before you can add a Dropbox
connection to an integration. If you did not already create a Dropbox connection,
see <<create-dropbox-connection>>.

You must be creating an integration or updating an integration to
add a connection to that integration. If you need to, see
<<procedure-for-creating-an-integration>> or <<updating-integrations>>.

The procedure for adding a Dropbox connection to an integration varies
according to whether you are adding the connection as the
start connection, the finish connection, or a middle connection.
